# Wall-e Chatbot!


## Interaction Instructions

* Wall-e will respond once you hit a submission limit of 5, 10, and 20. At 20, Wall-e will overheat and stop responding until you refresh
* If you submit an empty input, the system will respond for you by saying "I'm speechless"
* If you include a key term in your submission, Wall-e will offer a custom response.  Options are:
** eva (Wall-e will get excited and jump when you mention her name)
** wall-e
** garbage
** cockroach
** plant
** space
** alone
** name
** hi
** maia
** allie
* If you don't include a keyterm, Wall-e will offer a generic random response


## Interaction Notes

* Wall-e's eyes will rotate randomly between 0 - 20 degrees on each submission
* Site is mobile responsive, but only tested on Chrome


### Resource Notes (Thanks)
* I built an SVG image based upon Morgan's Wall-e drawing (http://www.morganmspencer.com/projects/index.html)
* I used animate.css for some of the animations
* I used Gulp for the front-end tooling
